She was so detail-oriented and made our big day run so smoothly. I told her what I needed, and she followed through even above my expectations. The resort is smaller, but we liked that so we could be close to all our friends and family. The beach is beautiful, and the restaurants at the resort were great. We got married on the Sky Deck. The view was breathtaking. It was a bit hot at 5 pm during our ceremony, but it cooled down for the reception, and the sunset was so beautiful.</p>",

First off, our wedding day was magical, and our planner Daniela was a true angel who fulfilled every wish, worry, concern, anything I threw her way, she made sure to take care of in the perfect manner. We still keep in touch as she will always hold a very special place in my heart. My husband and I will miss this place and the amazing time and memories we have are priceless and so precious! Jamaica and Moon Palace will always hold a special place in my heart, especially from our wedding day to all of these incredible people I mentioned above! We already miss each of you!</p>",

We also got a wedding breakfast in bed the next day, t-shirts, and lots of little gifts like a chocolate 'just married' car. We've been to Mexico a lot over the years, but this place is something else.</p>",

Amenities are amazing. All-inclusive options are 24/7 and actually include everything (food and drinks) at no extra charge, which is rare. If you are looking for a gorgeous place to get married, I highly suggest this resort. They made our wedding incredible, and their wedding day coordinator (Sarah) is AMAZING. We can't wait to return next year for our anniversary.</p>",

It's a true 5* experience - you definitely get what you pay for. The food, facilities, service, and cleanliness were all second to none. We had our wedding here, and it literally could not have been any more perfect. The whole wedding experience could not have been any better in any way for me and made it literally the best day of my life. I read LOTS of reviews before committing to Moon Palace as my wedding holiday venue, and it helped me to absolutely make the RIGHT choice. I'd recommend it 100% to anyone considering it for any special occasion or holiday (and feel it is suitable for literally any age!). This holiday really set the bar high for me, and I will definitely be looking to visit another Moon Palace for a family holiday.</p>",

We had 34 guests join us for our wedding, and everything about the resort, our stay, our wedding, and the food exceeded our expectations and was absolutely incredible from beginning to end!! By far, our biggest Thank You goes out to our wedding coordinator Stacy-ann. Stacy-ann was AMAZING!!! She literally went above and beyond and nailed every detail perfectly! At our first meeting with her, we could immediately tell how detailed and organized she is, and it definitely reassured us that she would take care of everything for us, which she did perfectly. Her staff, Khalil, the banquet manager, otherwise known as Jamaican Superman, was mi general throughout everything. We had the same serving staff and bartenders for our welcome dinner and wedding reception, and they treated us as if we were guests in their own homes.</p>",

We always aimed to find a moment like that for our wedding, Rebeca and her team made it possible. Orange is the color of the fall season, and Aidy and I are in our 60s and will live the autumn of our lives together, hence the orange wedding. To wed barefooted on the beach, according to the Mayan tradition, is to marry Mother Earth as well. Our guests were other nice couples we met during our stay—great place to get married or to renew vows. The personnel in charge of our wedding, led by Rebeca, were cordial, amicable, and second to none. We can say that also about the bartenders, waiters and waitresses, and all other support personnel. We highly recommend this resort for couples only, 40-45 min away from Cancun by boat. We are definitely going back for our 1st-anniversary celebration.</p>",
